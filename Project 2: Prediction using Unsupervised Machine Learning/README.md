# 🌼 Classification of Iris Dataset using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project focuses on the classification of the Iris dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to cluster the Iris flower samples based on their features and gain insights into the underlying patterns.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Iris dataset and group the samples into distinct clusters without using any predefined labels. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Exploration: Analyze the Iris dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions. Visualize the data to gain insights into the characteristics of the different Iris flower species.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or scaling the features, to prepare the dataset for unsupervised learning.

3. Model Development: Utilize unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering, to cluster the Iris samples based on their features. Experiment with different hyperparameters to find the optimal clustering solution.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the quality of the clustering results using internal validation metrics, such as silhouette score or inertia, to assess the compactness and separation of the clusters.
