# 📚 Prediction of Scores using Study Hours

This project focuses on predicting scores based on the number of study hours. The objective is to develop a supervised machine learning model that can accurately estimate scores for future study hours.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between study hours and scores and create a predictive model. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to gain insights into the distributions, patterns, and relationships between study hours and scores. Identify any outliers or significant features within the data.

2. Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and prepare the data for model training. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Model Development: Train a supervised machine learning model, such as linear regression, to predict scores based on study hours. Optimize the model parameters and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. Analyze the residuals to ensure the model's validity.
